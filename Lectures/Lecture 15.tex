\chapter{The proper base change theorem}

We begin with some general theory of proper maps. 

\section{Proper maps}

\begin{defn}
	A continuous map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces is \emph{universally closed} if for any map $X' \to X$ the base change $X \times_X Y \to Y$ is a closed map.
\end{defn}
